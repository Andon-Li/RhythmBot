Processing order.
1. Find Game Window
(Loop)
2. Capture an image of the highway
3. Scan the screen for:
    a. Purple tiles.
    b. Orange tiles.
    c. Release tiles. (later)
    d. Held note trails. (later)
4. Find the locations of each of those items.
5. Calculate the time that the note must be pressed.
6. Insert that data into a collection using the format: (lane number, key action, timestamp)
7. Check if the oldest notes in the collection have reached their time to be hit.
8. Input any note keys required.

Notes.
Analyzing the screen every cycle is unnecessary as notes will be readable for around 1 second.
Data collection type can be similar to a ring buffer. Python may not need this level of optimization.
Release tiles and Held note trails may need more advanced image processing than a simple color mask,
        so they will be a future addition to the program.

Record the timing of the highway.
    How does the relationship between timing and height of the note change as the height changes?
    Evenly spaced notes in time will not appear evenly spaced according to their height.
    The distance of a gap between notes will have higher weight on the timing of the gap if the distance is measured
            higher into the highway.


The top of the highway is approx. 381 pixels from the bottom of the highway.
Notes at the top of a 1/5 and 5/5 lane are approx. 121 pixels closer to the center than when they are at the bottom.
Notes at the top of a 2/5 and 4/5 lane are approx. 64 pixels closer to the center than when they are at the bottom.
Notes at the top of a 3/5 lane are always aligned at the center.

Notes take approx 1 second from top of highway to bottom of highway.

Exclude centers that lie outside of the highway.

Scan for high contrast areas for release notes
