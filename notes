Processing order.
1. Find Game Window
(Loop)
2. Capture an image of the highway
3. Scan the screen for:
    a. Purple tiles.
    b. Orange tiles.
    c. Release tiles. (later)
    d. Held note trails. (later)
4. Find the locations of each of those items.
5. Calculate the time that the note must be pressed.
6. Insert that data into a collection using the format: (lane number, key action, timestamp)
7. Check if the oldest notes in the collection have reached their time to be hit.
8. Input any note keys required.

Notes.
Analyzing the screen every cycle is unnecessary as notes will be readable for around 1 second.
Data collection type can be similar to a ring buffer. Python may not need this level of optimization.
Release tiles and Held note trails may need more advanced image processing than a simple color mask,
        so they will be a future addition to the program.

Record the timing of the highway.
    How does the relationship between timing and height of the note change as the height changes?
    Evenly spaced notes in time will not appear evenly spaced according to their height.
    The distance of a gap between notes will have higher weight on the timing of the gap if the distance is measured
            higher into the highway.


The top of the highway is approx. 381 pixels from the bottom of the highway.
Notes at the top of a 1/5 and 5/5 lane are approx. 121 pixels closer to the center than when they are at the bottom.
Notes at the top of a 2/5 and 4/5 lane are approx. 64 pixels closer to the center than when they are at the bottom.
Notes at the top of a 3/5 lane are always aligned at the center.

Notes take approx 1 second from top of highway to bottom of highway.

Exclude centers that lie outside of the highway.

Scan for high contrast areas for release notes
and lines

New Approach - Average color of center of lanes.
Crop image to only include area of the screen where sustain tails occupy.
Take the average of every row of pixels.
Categorize the average color into categories of each type of tile.

Challenges:
The centers of each lane are not clean rectangles. They are much closer to parallelogram.
The true shape of the center of the lanes are parallelograms while also thinning out at the top.

The color of each tile are not constant.
The color ranges must be carefully tuned

Simply color categories will result in tiles existing where it is impossible. eg: Sustain before any note as been played.

Assumptions:
    Fortnite is fullscreen on a 16:9 display.

Capture Dimensions (zero indexed):
    top = 480 / 1080 ~0.4444
    bottom = 480+108 / 1080 ~0.5444


initialization:
    find dimensions of the display

    based on the dimensions of the display, find the capture region.

    based on the capture region, use the Bresenham Line Algorithm to find the indices to scan.


Game Loop:
    capture the display.
    iterate through the indices of each lane:
        for each index:
            store the rgb color contained at that pixel
            convert the rgb to hsv
            check if the hsv matches any of the ranges for notes
                purple
                orange
                purple lift
                orange lift
            if yes:
                store the y value of the pixel that is inside the range.

                break the loop so that processing will move to the next lane
            if no:
